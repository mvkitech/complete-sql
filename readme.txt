This is the project exercise code from a Udemy "NodeJS - The Complete Guide" course.

This initial code check in starts at Lesson #139 just prior to hooking up the MySQL database
and the plan is to carry forward with all coding changes using MySQL even though the course
itself will change direction fairly soon and begin using the NoSQL database mongoDB. As far
as mongoDB is concerned, it is believed that I will fork this repository when the time is
right and I will then need to make sure all non-database related code changes are made in
this respository as well as the forked repository.

As usual with anything related to Node JS, the "node_modules" folder was excluded so the 
need to run "npm install" will have to be done if/when this repository is copied to a 
different machine and/or folder than the original master instance.
